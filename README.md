# Electrical-Potential-Biofilm

By running the `biofilm_sim.py` script, you are running a one-dimensional model from the paper "A Two-Dimensional Model of Potassium Signaling and Oscillatory Growth in a Biofilm."

Note: this script attempts to stay true to the model from the paper, but there may be some differences.
